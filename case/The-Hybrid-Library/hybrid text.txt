The Hybrid Library
Amsterdam / Mixed use / 15.000 m2 / Orlindo Caso


Hybrid buildings are all about creating innovative combinations of functions to create new hybrid typologies. In this case a music stage is added to a library and is combined with student housing. Together this bottom-up urban intervention aspires to spark fresh momentum for the neighbourhood. The design revolves around the spatial concept of a slanted atrium, leading the visitor up into the building, towards the stage. Transitions between the main spaces define the character of the building. For instance, a slight ramp invites you into the library and a couple of steps gives a few degrees of privacy to the shared garden.
