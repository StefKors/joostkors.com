Hard Transits
RAM Galleri, Oslo / Exhibition / 50 m2 / Neil Forrest


Giant ceramic ships, suspended in the air, each with their own story to tell. Proud adventures of men trapped in ice are intersected with relics of more painful stories on Norwegian history. This exhibition was a collaboration with ceramic artist Neil Forrest. I was involved with assisting the build of the ships, designing the mounting systems and responsible for all graphic materials.
