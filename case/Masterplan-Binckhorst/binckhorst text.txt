Masterplan De Binckhorst
The Hague / Urban Plan / 130 ha


Winning submission for a faculty competition. The plan focusses on 5 knowledge factories that provide startup possibilities and rejuvenate the area from the inside. My role was focused on infrastructure, making sure that the busy traffic was dealt with in an adequate manner. The desired high density asked for a lot of capacity in public transport. The street profiles and traffic system try to separate different kinds of traffic. They are designed to lead passersby under and along the edge of the neighbourhood and keep inside traffic slow. The main challenge was working with a group of 14 people representing different disciplines in a very short timeframe.
