Redesign Archives NAI
Rotterdam / Technical / 1000 m2


A purely technical redesign of a prominent building. The redesign focusses on a decentralized self-supporting climate system. The current programme does not ask much of heating or cooling load, but the future may ask for a different use. Therefore the solution is modular. Identical modules can be added later to cover the whole facade in order to increase the capacity of the system. They are like glass backpacks attached to the facade. The closed system provides heating, cooling, ventilation, electricity and light independently. The only thing it could possibly need from the outside is internet.
